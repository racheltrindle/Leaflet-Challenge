The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and pick a data set to visualize (JSON). Use the URL of the JSON to pull data for visualization.


Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

Pop-ups provide additional information about the earthquake.
